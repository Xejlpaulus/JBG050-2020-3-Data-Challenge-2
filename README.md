# JBG050-2020-3-Data-Challenge-2
In the course JBG050 students identify a problem in a larger problem landscape and the corresponding problem owner. They conduct an analysis for the problem owner and communicate the results to him, i.e., a non-technical audience.

As all of the the data challenge courses, JBG050 is designed to
* link the technical skills from their theoretical introduction in the courses to a practical, problem-oriented context, and
* lift the studentsâ€™ technical skills from knowledge, theoretical understanding, and basic application to advanced application and problem solving.
